	Task: Query the list of CITY names from STATION which have vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, and u) as both their first and last characters. 
		Your result cannot contain duplicates.

__________________________________________________________
	Approach-1: Using Like clause 

		SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION 
		WHERE 
  			(CITY LIKE 'a%' OR CITY LIKE 'e%' OR CITY LIKE 'i%' OR CITY LIKE 'o%' OR CITY LIKE 'u%')
   		 AND 
    			(CITY LIKE '%a' OR CITY LIKE '%e' OR CITY LIKE '%i' OR CITY LIKE '%o' OR CITY LIKE '%u');


		Explanation 
			LIKE operator  â†’ Ensure that 1st letter should be vowels 


___________________________________________________________
	Approach-2:using REGEXP (applicable only to MySQL )

		SELECT CITY FROM STATION
		WHERE 
			CITY REXEXP '^[aeiou]'
			AND 
			CITY REXEXP '$[aeiou]'
		Explanation 
			REGEXP  â†’ Ensure that 1st letter should be vowels  

___________________________________________________________
	Approach-3:using LEFT/RIGHT() with IN 

		SELECT DISTINCT CITYFROM STATION
		WHERE 
    			LEFT(CITY, 1) IN ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u')
		    AND 
			RIGHT(CITY, 1) IN ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u');
		
		Explanation 
			LEFT  â†’ Ensure that 1st letter should be vowels  
			RIGHT  â†’ Ensure that LAST letter should be vowels
