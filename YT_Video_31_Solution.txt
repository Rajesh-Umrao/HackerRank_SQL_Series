ðŸ‘‰Problem: The Earners

We define an employee's total earnings to be their monthly monthsxsalary worked, 
and the maximum total earnings to be the maximum total earnings for any employee in the Employee table. 
Write a query to find the maximum total earnings for all employees as well as the total number of employees who have maximum total earnings. 
Then print these values as  space-separated integers.

__________________________________________________________
ðŸ‘‰SOLUTION-1:  Using CTE (Common Table Expression)
WITH temp AS (
    SELECT (months * salary) AS earnings
    FROM Employee
)
SELECT MAX(earnings), COUNT(*)
FROM temp
WHERE earnings = (SELECT MAX(earnings) FROM temp);

__________________________________________________________
ðŸ‘‰SOLUTION-2: using SUB-QUERY 
SELECT MAX(earnings), COUNT(*)
FROM (
    SELECT (months * salary) AS earnings
    FROM Employee
) AS temp
WHERE earnings = (
    SELECT MAX(months * salary) FROM Employee
);
