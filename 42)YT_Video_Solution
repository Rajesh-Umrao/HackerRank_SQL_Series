👉Problem 1️⃣: Contest Leaderboard 

You did such a great job helping Julia with her last coding contest challenge that she wants you to work on this one, too!

The total score of a hacker is the sum of their maximum scores for all of the challenges. Write a query to print the hacker_id, name, and total score of the hackers ordered by the descending score.
If more than one hacker achieved the same total score, then sort the result by ascending hacker_id. Exclude all hackers with a total score of 0 from your result.

    GROUP BY hacker_id, challenge_id

    total_score
FROM TotalScores
WHERE total_score > 0
ORDER BY total_score DESC, hacker_id ASC;
