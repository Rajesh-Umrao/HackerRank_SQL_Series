ðŸ”¹â‘  Problem: Type of triangle 
	
Task: Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

Equilateral: Itâ€™s a triangle with 3 sides of equal length.
Isosceles: Itâ€™s a triangle with 2 sides of equal length.
Scalene: Itâ€™s a triangle with all sides of differing lengths.
Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C donâ€™t form a triangle.

Approach-1 

SELECT A, B, C,
       CASE 
           WHEN A + B <= C OR A + C <= B OR B + C <= A THEN 'Not A Triangle'
           WHEN A = B AND B = C THEN 'Equilateral'
           WHEN A = B OR B = C OR A = C THEN 'Isosceles'
           ELSE 'Scalene'
       END AS Triangle_Type
FROM TRIANGLES;


ðŸ”Ž Explanation
A + B <= C OR A + C <= B OR B + C <= A â†’ If any two sides' sum is not greater than the third, itâ€™s Not A Triangle.
A = B AND B = C â†’ If all three sides are equal, it's an Equilateral triangle.
A = B OR B = C OR A = C â†’ If exactly two sides are equal, it's an Isosceles triangle.
ELSE â†’ If all sides are different, it's a Scalene triangle.
