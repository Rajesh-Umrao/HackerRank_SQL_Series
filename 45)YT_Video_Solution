ðŸ‘‰Problem:: Symmetric Pairs
	You are given a table, Functions, containing two columns: X and Y.
	Two pairs (X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2) are said to be symmetric pairs if X1 = Y2 and X2 = Y1.
	Write a query to output all such symmetric pairs in ascending order by the value of X. List the rows such that X1 â‰¤ Y1.


ðŸ“°SOLUTION: Approach-1 
----------------------------------------------------------------
SELECT 
    f1.x,f1.y FROM functions as f1 
JOIN functions as f2
ON f1.x=f2.y and f2.x=f1.y 
GROUP BY f1.x,f1.y 
HAVING COUNT(f1.x)>1 OR f1.X<f1.Y ORDER BY f1.x 
--------------------------------------------------------------

ðŸ“°SOLUTION: Approach-2
----------------------------------------------------------------
WITH Numbered AS (
    SELECT 
        X,
        Y,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY (SELECT NULL)) AS row_num
    FROM Functions
)
SELECT DISTINCT 
    LEAST(f1.X, f1.Y) AS X,
    GREATEST(f1.X, f1.Y) AS Y
FROM Numbered f1
JOIN Numbered f2
    ON f1.X = f2.Y AND f1.Y = f2.X
WHERE f1.row_num < f2.row_num
ORDER BY X;
