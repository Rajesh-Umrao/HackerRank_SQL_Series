ðŸ‘‰Problem: Weather Observation Station 20

A median is defined as a number separating the higher half of a data set from the lower half. 
Query the median of the Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION and round your answer to  4 decimal places. 

-------------------
ðŸ‘‰SOLUTION:MYSQL : SUB-QUERY 
SELECT 
    ROUND(AVG(LAT_N), 4) AS median_lat
FROM (
    SELECT LAT_N,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY LAT_N) AS rn,
           COUNT(*) OVER () AS total
    FROM STATION
) AS ordered
WHERE rn IN (FLOOR((total + 1) / 2), CEIL((total + 1) / 2));



-------------------
ðŸ‘‰SOLUTION:MYSQL : USING CTE

WITH temp as (
	 SELECT LAT_N,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY LAT_N) AS rn,
           COUNT(*) OVER () AS total
    FROM STATION
)

SELECT 
    ROUND(AVG(LAT_N), 4) AS median_lat 
FROM temp
WHERE rn IN (FLOOR((total + 1) / 2), CEIL((total + 1) / 2));
