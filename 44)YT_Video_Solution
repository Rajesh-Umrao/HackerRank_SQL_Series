👉Problem 1️⃣: Placements

You are given three tables: Students, Friends and Packages. Students contains two columns: ID and Name. Friends contains two columns: ID and Friend_ID (ID of the ONLY best friend). Packages contains two columns: ID and Salary (offered salary in $ thousands per month).

Write a query to output the names of those students whose best friends got offered a higher salary than them. Names must be ordered by the salary amount offered to the best friends. It is guaranteed that no two students got same salary offer.

📰SOLUTION:MS-SQL-SERVER : Approach-1 using Basic join 
----------------------------------------------------------------
SELECT s.Name
FROM Students s
JOIN Friends f ON s.ID = f.ID
JOIN Packages sp ON s.ID = sp.ID         -- Student's salary
JOIN Packages fp ON f.Friend_ID = fp.ID  -- Friend's salary
WHERE fp.Salary > sp.Salary
ORDER BY fp.Salary;

---------------------------------------------------------------
📰SOLUTION:MS-SQL-SERVER : Approach-2 using CTE 
with temp1 as (
select 
    s.id, 
    s.name, 
    f.friend_id    
from students as s 
join friends as f on s.id=f.id
),

temp2 as(
select 
    t1.id,
    t1.name, 
    t1.friend_id, 
    p1.salary as student_salary, 
    p2.salary as friend_salary
from temp1 as t1
join packages as p1 on t1.id = p1.id
join packages as p2 on t1.friend_id = p2.id
)
select 
    name
from temp2
where friend_salary > student_salary
order by friend_salary
