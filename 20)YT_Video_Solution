ðŸ”¹â‘  Problem: The PADS
	
Task: Generate the following two result sets:

A) Query an alphabetically ordered list of all names in OCCUPATIONS, immediately followed by the first letter of each profession as a parenthetical (i.e.: enclosed in parentheses). For example: AnActorName(A), ADoctorName(D), AProfessorName(P), and ASingerName(S).

B) Query the number of ocurrences of each occupation in OCCUPATIONS. Sort the occurrences in ascending order, and output them in the following format:
	There are a total of [occupation_count] [occupation]s.
		where [occupation_count] is the number of occurrences of an occupation in OCCUPATIONS and [occupation] is the lowercase occupation name.
		If more than one Occupation has the same [occupation_count], they should be ordered alphabetically.

	Note: There will be at least two entries in the table for each type of occupation.

SOLUTION

ðŸ’» SQL Query for Alphabetical Name Formatting
-- Method:1 using concat function 
SELECT CONCAT (NAME,'(',LEFT(OCCUPATION,1),')') FROM OCCUPATIONS 
ORDER BY NAME;


--method:2 : using pipe operator(||)
SELECT Name || '(' || SUBSTR(Occupation, 1, 1) || ')' AS Formatted_Name
FROM OCCUPATIONS
ORDER BY Name;

ðŸ”Ž Explanation
SUBSTR(Occupation, 1, 1) â†’ Extracts the first letter of the occupation.
Name || '(' || ... || ')' â†’ Concatenates the name with the formatted occupation initial.
ORDER BY Name â†’ Sorts the names alphabetically.

ðŸ’» SQL Query for Counting Occupations

--method-1: using concat function
SELECT CONCAT('There are a total of ', COUNT(OCCUPATION), ' ', LOWER(OCCUPATION), 's.') AS Result
FROM OCCUPATIONS
GROUP BY OCCUPATION
ORDER BY COUNT(OCCUPATION), LOWER(OCCUPATION);


--method-2 using pipe operator(||)
SELECT 'There are a total of ' || COUNT(*) || ' ' || LOWER(Occupation) || 's.'
AS Occupation_Count
FROM OCCUPATIONS
GROUP BY Occupation
ORDER BY COUNT(*), Occupation;

ðŸ”Ž Explanation
COUNT(*) â†’ Counts the number of times each occupation appears.
LOWER(Occupation) || 's' â†’ Converts the occupation to lowercase and appends "s".
GROUP BY Occupation â†’ Groups results by occupation.
ORDER BY COUNT(*), Occupation â†’ Sorts by ascending count, and then alphabetically if counts are the same.
