ðŸ”¹â‘  Problem: Weather Observation Station 9
	
Task: Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not start with vowels. 
Your result cannot contain duplicates.

__________________________________________________________
Approach-1: Using Like clause 

SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE CITY NOT LIKE '%A'
AND CITY NOT LIKE '%E'
AND CITY NOT LIKE '%I'
AND CITY NOT LIKE '%O'
AND CITY NOT LIKE '%U';


Explanation 
LIKE '%A' checks if the city name ends with A
Repeat for all vowels
Use NOT LIKE to exclude these cases
Works in almost every SQL dialect (MySQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Oracle)


___________________________________________________________
Approach-2:using REGEXP (applicable only to MySQL )

SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE CITY NOT REGEXP '[aeiouAEIOU]$';

Explanation:

[aeiouAEIOU] matches any vowel (case-insensitive)
$ ensures it checks only the last character
NOT REGEXP ensures vowels are excluded

Approach-3:using LEFT/RIGHT() with IN 

SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE RIGHT(CITY, 1) NOT IN ('A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U');

Explanation:

RIGHT(CITY, 1) fetches the last character
NOT IN filters out vowels
