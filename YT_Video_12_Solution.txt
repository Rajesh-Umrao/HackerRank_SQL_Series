ðŸ”¹â‘  Problem: Weather Observation Station 9
	
Task: Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not start with vowels. 
Your result cannot contain duplicates.

__________________________________________________________
Approach-1: Using Like clause 

SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE CITY NOT LIKE 'A%'
AND CITY NOT LIKE 'E%'
AND CITY NOT LIKE 'I%'
AND CITY NOT LIKE 'O%'
AND CITY NOT LIKE 'U%';



Explanation 

NOT LIKE 'A%' excludes cities starting with 'A'
Repeat for E, I, O, U
This works for both uppercase and lowercase automatically (in most databases).


___________________________________________________________
Approach-2:using REGEXP (applicable only to MySQL )

SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE CITY NOT REGEXP '^[AEIOUaeiou]';

Explanation:

^ means the start of the string.
[AEIOUaeiou] is a character class matching any vowel.
NOT REGEXP excludes cities starting with any vowel.



___________________________________________________________
Approach-3:using LEFT/RIGHT() with IN 

SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE LEFT(CITY, 1) NOT IN ('A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U');

Explanation:

LEFT(CITY, 1) gives the first character.
NOT IN excludes vowels.
This is highly readable and works in almost all SQL dialects.
