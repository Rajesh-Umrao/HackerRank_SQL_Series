ðŸ”¹â‘  Problem: Weather Observation Station 12
	
Task: Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not start with vowels and do not end with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

_________________________________________________________
Approach-1: Using Like clause 

SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE CITY NOT LIKE 'A%' 
   AND CITY NOT LIKE 'E%' 
   AND CITY NOT LIKE 'I%' 
   AND CITY NOT LIKE 'O%' 
   AND CITY NOT LIKE 'U%'
ANDCITY NOT LIKE '%A'
   AND CITY NOT LIKE '%E'
   AND CITY NOT LIKE '%I'
   AND CITY NOT LIKE '%O'
   AND CITY NOT LIKE '%U';



Explanation 
The first half checks if the city does not start with a vowel.
The second half checks if the city does not end with a vowel.
The AND ensures both condition is met, the city is included.
Works in all major databases (MySQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc.)

Approach-2:using REGEXP (applicable only to MySQL )

SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE CITY NOT REGEXP '^[aeiouAEIOU]' 
   AND CITY NOT REGEXP '[aeiouAEIOU]$';


Explanation:

^[aeiouAEIOU] â€” Matches cities that start with a vowel
[aeiouAEIOU]$ â€” Matches cities that end with a vowel
NOT REGEXP flips the logic, so we only get non-vowel starters or enders.

Approach-3:using LEFT/RIGHT() with IN 

SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE LEFT(CITY, 1) NOT IN ('A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U')
   AND RIGHT(CITY, 1) NOT IN ('A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U');


Explanation:

LEFT() gets the first character
RIGHT() gets the last character
NOT IN excludes vowels
